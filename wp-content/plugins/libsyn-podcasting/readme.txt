The Libsyn podcast plugin allows Libsyn producers to publish their podcast right from Wordpress for easy management of their show.

== Description ==

**Currently in BETA**

**Libsyn Hosting Account Required**

Not already hosting with Libsyn? Sign up at http://libsyn.com, or contact support@libsyn.com for details.

Connect your Libsyn podcast hosting service to your Wordpress site for easy episode publishing. This plugin will allow easy creation of episodes, generating episode drafts, and scheduling posts.

Media file uploads direct to Libsyn, as well as by using already loaded Wordpress media or access your Libsyn FTP Dropbox all from one place.

Your media files stay hosted with Libsyn, and your RSS feed will still be generated by Libsyn as well, meaning your web hosting server remains unaffected by your podcast and your RSS feed and media files are unaffected by your web hosting server. Itâ€™s the best of both worlds.
